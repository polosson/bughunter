# Bughunter
### Small, simple and pretty bug tracker / todo system, for collaborative code projects

This bug tracker is intented to be used with an **API** to add bugs from your own application. There is no users management in it, just an "admin" password allowing you to manage bugs (CRUD) and comment them.

Admin password is "**admin**". Try it!
