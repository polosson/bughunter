# Bughunter
### Small, simple and pretty bug tracker / todo system, for collaborative code projects

This bug tracker is intented to be used with an **API** to add bugs from your own application. There is no users management in it, just an "admin" password allowing you to manage bugs (CRUD) and comment them.

----
There is a demo running here : http://bughunter-demo.polosson.com

Admin password is "**admin**". Try it!

----
#### Install process
  - Clone or download this repo
  - Copy it to your server into a folder
  - Create an empty MySQL database on your server
  - Go to this folder's URL
  - Follow the installer 3 steps (MySQL connection, database structuration, project's informations)
  - Done !

----
#### Remaining to do:
  - <s>Email Notification system : new bug, close bug, new comment, assign bug</s>
  - <s>auto resize uploaded image if too big</s>
  - <s>Download SQL dump and images files ("backup" button in settings)</s>
  - <s>Global reset of the whole Bughunter ("reset" button in settings)</s>
  - <s>Language translation (English & French done)</s>
  - <s>Heartbeat to check bugs list every x minutes</s>
  - Admin connexion with dev pseudo (not only main password)
  - clean CSS ^^
