# Bughunter
### Small, simple and pretty bug tracker for collaborative code projects

This bug tracker is intented to be used with an **API** to add bugs from your own application. There is no users management in it, just an "admin" password allowing you to manage bugs and comment them.

----
There is a demo running here : http://bughunter-demo.polosson.com

Admin password is "**admin**". Try it!

Remaining to do:
  - Email Notification system
  - auto resize uploaded image if too big
  - nodejs or heartbeat to sync bugs list
  - clean CSS ^^
